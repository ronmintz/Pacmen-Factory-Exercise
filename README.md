# Pacmen Factory Exercise
## Factory for making pacmen.

There are two buttons on the screen.  Each time the button labelled "AddPacMan" is pressed, a new PacMan is created at a random location and assigned a random velocity, but it does not move until the button labelled "Start Game" is pressed.  Pressing "Start Game" causes all the PacMen to start moving, each at the velocity that was assigned to it when it was created.  Even after starting the game, pressing "Add PacMan" causes a new PacMan to be added, which will move at its assigned velocity.  Whenever any PacMan collides with any boundary of the screen, the component of its velocity in the direction perpendicular to the screen boundary is reversed, so it bounces off the wall and remains within the boundaries of the screen.  To run this project, clone this repository to a PC and double-click on the icon for index.html in the File Explorer.  Then proceed with clicking the
"AddPacMan" and "Start Game" buttons.

Possible future improvements include use of all four PacMan images, causing each Pacman to open and close his mouth and face in the direction he is moving.  We could also assign random sizes to each PacMan.  We could have Pacmen bouncing off each other
when they collide.
